abstract: Social vulnerability indices have found widespread acceptance and
  application in planning and risk management. However, though a valuable tool
  for addressing equity concerns, prior studies have demonstrated shortcomings
  of such indices in terms of their reliability and validity. While index
  uncertainty associated with level of data resolution has been thoroughly
  examined, the impact of varying geographic extents has received less
  attention, and index consistency across the entire United States and over time
  has not been previously studied. In this study I examine variability
  associated with changing data resolution and geographic extent for four years
  of social vulnerability indices for the United States, quantifying
  inconsistencies across 32 index variants, and helping to explain why these
  inconsistencies occur. I find that changes in data resolution and extent lead
  to vulnerability designation switching in nearly 22 % of index variant
  comparisons between 2019 and 2021. In addition, at least 50 % of block groups
  are subject to at least one instance of vulnerability designation switching
  when comparing across all index variants. The results suggest that index
  inconsistencies are partly the result of spatial non-stationarity in
  vulnerability processes and confirm that prior findings for case studies apply
  across the entire U.S. In addition, I find that rural and tribal areas are
  prone to higher variability in index values, and identify13,872 block groups
  where social vulnerability metrics are relatively consistent. Overall, this
  study reinforces the evidence suggesting that social vulnerability indices
  constructed with different scales of data can produce inconsistent patterns in
  relative vulnerability measures and supports calls for caution in their
  application for decision-making.
