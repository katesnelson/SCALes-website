abstract: Government agencies and researchers often rely on quantitative
  measures to map where rural places are and who belongs to rural communities.
  To better understand the consistency, or lack thereof, across different
  quantitative rural measures, we compare four common measures applied at the
  county level for the contiguous United States. Our purpose was to (1) quantify
  and map the degree of rural agreement among these selected rural measures and
  (2) describe key characteristics of counties classified as rural through
  urban. We found that different measures yielded little agreement on rural
  places with consensus of only 114 of 3108 counties. County variables
  contributing to good separability in rural to urban classifications included
  remoteness, population density, percent of the population aged 65 and over,
  employment in the agricultural sector, and both developed and grassland
  landcover. Closer examination of the underlying characteristics of the 114
  consensus rural counties provides an opportunity to reflect on the nature of
  popular rural measures and the variables they use. If these counties are not
  representative of how researchers conceptualize “rural” across US regions, it
  is motivation for working toward new and/or spatially adaptive rural measures
  that better represent the communities that policy and research intends to
  help.
