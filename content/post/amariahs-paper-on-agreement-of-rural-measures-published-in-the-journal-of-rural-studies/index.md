Aï»¿mariah's paper, "[Where is rural? An analysis of the agreement between quantitative measures of rurality](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2024.103424)" was published in the Journal of Rural Studies in October. The paper compares four common approaches to characterizing rural areas in the U.S. and finds a high degree of inconsistency across rural designations. A set of only 114 counties were classified as rural across all four approaches.
