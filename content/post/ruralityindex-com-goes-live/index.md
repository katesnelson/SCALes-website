Tï»¿he Community Assets and Relative Rurality (CARR) index now has its own website at [ruralityindex.com](https://ruralityindex.com/)! On the website we provide open access to the original block group scale CARR data as well as CARR data for several additional spatial scales including: school districts, ZIP codes, and counties. Documentation on each variant can also be found on the website.
